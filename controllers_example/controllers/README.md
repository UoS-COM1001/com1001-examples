# `Controllers` directory

This is the directory where your controller files should live. There is
currently one file, called `main.rb` with a default route (`get /`). You can
rename this file and change the operation of the route. You can also add more
controller files by creating logical groupings of different routes, resulting in
smaller, more maintainable code files. For example, different controllers for
the user-facing part of your system and the administration part.
